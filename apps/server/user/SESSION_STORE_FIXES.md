# Session Store Error Fixes

This document outlines the fixes applied to resolve the Prisma session store errors encountered during login.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Foreign Key Constraint Violation (P2003)
**Problem**: Session store was trying to create sessions with `userId: 'anonymous'`, but the foreign key constraint required a valid user ID that exists in the users table.

**Solution**:
- Modified the Prisma schema to make `userId` optional (`String?`)
- Updated the User relation to be optional (`User?`)
- Changed session store to use `null` instead of `'anonymous'`
- Updated database schema with `npm run db:push`

### 2. Record Not Found Error (P2025)
**Problem**: Session destroy operation was trying to delete sessions that didn't exist, causing Prisma errors.

**Solution**:
- Changed `delete()` to `deleteMany()` in the destroy method
- `deleteMany()` doesn't throw errors if no records are found
- Added proper logging to track deletion results

### 3. Headers Already Sent Error
**Problem**: Multiple response attempts were being made when errors occurred, causing Express.js to throw "Cannot set headers after they are sent" errors.

**Solution**:
- Added header check in global error handler
- Enhanced session save error handling in login route
- Improved error handling throughout the session store

### 4. Session Store Method Improvements
**Problem**: Various session store methods weren't handling edge cases properly.

**Solutions**:
- **get()**: Added better error logging and handling
- **touch()**: Changed `update()` to `updateMany()` to handle non-existent sessions
- **set()**: Added conditional userId updates and better error handling
- **destroy()**: Uses `deleteMany()` for graceful handling

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/lib/prisma-session-store.ts`
- Enhanced error handling throughout all methods
- Changed delete operations to use `deleteMany()`
- Improved logging for debugging
- Added null handling for anonymous sessions

### 2. `prisma/schema.prisma`
- Made `userId` optional (`String?`) in Session model
- Made User relation optional (`User?`)
- Allows sessions to exist without authenticated users

### 3. `src/index.ts`
- Enhanced global error handler with header check
- Prevents multiple response attempts

### 4. `src/routes/auth.ts`
- Added explicit session save with error handling
- Enhanced login flow with better error management

## Key Changes Summary

### Session Model (Before)
```prisma
model Session {
  userId    String
  user User @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
}
```

### Session Model (After)
```prisma
model Session {
  userId    String?
  user User? @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
}
```

### Session Store Methods
- **destroy()**: `delete()` → `deleteMany()`
- **touch()**: `update()` → `updateMany()`
- **set()**: Added null userId handling
- **get()**: Enhanced error logging

### Error Handling
- Added header sent checks
- Improved session save error handling
- Enhanced logging throughout

## Benefits

1. **Robust Session Handling**: Sessions can now exist before user authentication
2. **Error Resilience**: Operations don't fail when records don't exist
3. **Better Debugging**: Enhanced logging for troubleshooting
4. **Scalable Architecture**: Supports anonymous and authenticated sessions
5. **Production Ready**: Proper error handling prevents crashes

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Anonymous Sessions**: Test that sessions work before login
2. **Login Flow**: Verify sessions are properly associated with users after login
3. **Logout Flow**: Ensure sessions are properly destroyed
4. **Multiple Sessions**: Test concurrent sessions for same user
5. **Server Restart**: Verify session persistence across restarts

## Database Migration

The schema changes were applied using:
```bash
npm run db:push
```

This made the `userId` field optional, allowing sessions to exist without user association initially, then be updated when users authenticate.

## Production Considerations

1. **Session Cleanup**: The automatic cleanup runs every hour to remove expired sessions
2. **Performance**: `deleteMany()` and `updateMany()` operations are more efficient for batch operations
3. **Monitoring**: Enhanced logging helps with production debugging
4. **Scalability**: Optional userId allows for better session management across multiple instances

The session store is now robust, error-resilient, and production-ready!
